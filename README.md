# 10k_statistical_inferences
First project on GitHub - analyzing games of chance.

A while back my mom taught me a fun dice game called 10,000 (10k). The rules are laid out clearly here. 

This is a game of decision making and chance, but it wasn't clear from our few games what the optimal strategy was. 

Enter statistical inference. I recently started taking courses on DataCamp and learned some neat strategies for simulating and analyzing data, visualizing those results and drawing conclusions from them. 

So, I wanted to apply said strategies to a real world problem. A dice game problem. Hey, we all gotta start somewhere.
