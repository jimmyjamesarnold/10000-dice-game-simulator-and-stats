# Simulating the dice game 10000 and running stats in Python 
First project on GitHub!

A while back my mom taught me a fun dice game called 10,000 (10k). The rules are laid out clearly here. https://www.wikihow.com/Play-10000
I will add that this is considered a 'folk' game with a lot of variations and house rules. I have coded this simulate our house rules.


# Rationale
From playing a few games with my mom, it wasn't clear to me what the optimal strategy was, but because there's a cost tied to continued rolling, there's likely an optimal threshold to lock in your winnings. In my experience, I fell prey to the 'hot hand' fallacy, where I figured the good rolls would keep coming. I dominated a few games but overall lost more frequently than I won. My mom, based on observing many games, thinks that 350 is a safe threshold once you're on the board. 

So let's test it! 

Enter statistical inference. I've been taking courses on DataCamp recently and learned some neat strategies for simulating and analyzing data, visualizing those results and drawing conclusions from them. And I'm going to apply them here. One as good practice in coding up games and logic, and 2 for flexing my stats and plotting skills.
